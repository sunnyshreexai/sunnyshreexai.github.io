I am a PhD graduate from the [University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu/), where I conducted my research under the guidance of [Dr. Jeff Lei](https://www.uta.edu/academics/faculty/profile?username=ylei). My research interests lie **at the intersection of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence**, with a focus on the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-enabled software systems. 

Throughout my PhD, I specialized in **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Explainable AI (XAI)**, and **Generative AI**. I am experienced in building **reliable and transparent AI systems**, **fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **debugging and optimizing ML models and frameworks**, conducting software testing and probabilistic modeling, and leading large-scale experimental research to enhance AI robustness and interpretability.

I am driven by the goal of overcoming the engineering challenges associated with developing methodologies that ensure the **robust, ethical, and transparent deployment of AI technologies**. My current focus includes advancing **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)**, **fine-tuning** and **deploying machine learning models** with an emphasis on **reliability** and **transparency**, and innovating new approaches for the **testing and debugging of ML/AI systems**.
