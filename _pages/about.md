I am a PhD graduate from the [University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu/), where I conducted my research under the guidance of [Dr. Jeff Lei](https://www.uta.edu/academics/faculty/profile?username=ylei). My research interests lie **at the intersection of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence**, with a focus on the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-enabled software systems. 

I am driven by the goal of overcoming the engineering challenges associated with developing methodologies that ensure the **robustness and ethical deployment of AI technologies**. My current focus is on developing approaches to **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)** and the **testing and debugging of ML/AI systems**.
