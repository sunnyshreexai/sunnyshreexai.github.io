I am an AI Research Scientist specializing in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Generative AI**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. Currently, I work at a stealth AI startup (Beta Testing Phase, To be Launched soon), developing scalable, cutting-edge solutions that push the boundaries of language understanding and generation.

I hold a PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from the [University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu/), where I conducted research under the supervision of [Dr. Jeff Lei](https://www.uta.edu/academics/faculty/profile?username=ylei). My doctoral work focused on improving the reliability and interpretability of ML systems through **Explainable AI (XAI)**, robustness testing, and automated model debugging, leading to practical frameworks for analyzing model failures, mitigating bias, and enhancing performance stability under real-world conditions.

My expertise spans **deep learning**, **NLP**, **LLMs**, and **generative model architectures**, with experience in transformer fine-tuning, pretrained model adaptation, and developing LLM-based frameworks. I specialize in building **reliable and transparent AI systems**â€”advancing interpretability, robustness analysis, and automated fault localization across complex ML pipelines.

I am passionate about advancing the **trustworthiness** and **ethical deployment** of AI technologies, bridging research innovation with practical engineering solutions that ensure AI systems are robust, fair, and interpretable.
