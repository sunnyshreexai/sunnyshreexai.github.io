My research is centered at the intersection of **Software Engineering** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, where I address the critical challenges of establishing **standards**, **measurements**, and **safeguards** for **AI-enabled software systems**. My work focuses on ensuring the **reliability** and **trustworthiness** of **AI technologies** by developing methodologies that make **machine learning (ML)-based systems** more **transparent**, **interpretable**, and **robust**.

I am particularly passionate about advancing **Explainable AI (XAI)** methodologies and exploring approaches to the **testing** and **debugging** of **ML-based AI systems**, including critical areas such as **privacy testing**, **security testing**, and **fairness testing**. Ultimately, my research seeks to overcome the **engineering challenges** associated with ensuring that **AI technologies** are not only **advanced** but also **trustworthy**, **responsible**, and aligned with **ethical standards**.
