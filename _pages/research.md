My research is centered at the intersection of **Software Engineering** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, where I address the critical challenges of establishing **standards**, **measurements**, and **safeguards** for **AI-enabled software systems**. I focus on enhancing the **reliability**, **transparency**, and **trustworthiness** of **ML-based systems** by developing methodologies that improve their **interpretability**, **robustness**, and **ethical deployment**.

Specifically, I am passionate about advancing **Explainable AI (XAI)**, fine-tuning and deploying **large-scale machine learning (ML) models** with a focus on **reliability** and **transparency**, and innovating new techniques for the **testing** and **debugging** of **ML/AI systems**. My work also encompasses critical areas such as **privacy testing**, **security testing**, and **fairness auditing**. Ultimately, my research seeks to overcome the **engineering challenges** associated with building **AI technologies** that are not only **technically advanced** but also **trustworthy**, **responsible**, and aligned with **societal and ethical standards**.
